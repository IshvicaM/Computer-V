Research Goal: 
Many research studies in the field of Computer Vision rely on technology and machine learning to compile, extract, and analyze data. 
Computer Vision (CV) is a field in Artificial Intelligence that uses computer algorithms to analyze visual data. However, machine learning 
models that train on visual data may be biased, and can ultimately result in misleading or inaccurate data analysis. For example, 
machine learning (ML) models that train on skin cancer lesions on only White patients might be more inaccurate in predicting skin cancer lesions
on Black/non-White patients. In addition, ML models that train on data sets produced from specific countries, such as those that are high-income
or monoethnic, can produce bias when being implemented in patients who are not represented in the training data sets.

This research project aims to uncover potential bias in CV studies related to chest x-ray (CXR) images and CT scans. CXR- and CT- related studies 
were first compiled. They were then loaded into a Python Notebook and were further analyzed to determine the country of origin, primary institution, 
and author information of each study. These data were then visualized in graphs to depict the top countries that produce the most amount of 
CXR- and CT- related data sets. Top journals and their publishing countries were graphed as well.
